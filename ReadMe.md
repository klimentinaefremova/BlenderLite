  # Blender Lite
  # In Progress, Not yet finished

Blender Lite is a simplified 3D modeling and visualization application developed as part of the Computer Graphics course project. The goal of the project is to implement a lightweight version of Blender, featuring essential 3D manipulation tools and an intuitive interface for basic object creation, transformation, and visualization.

# Project Overview

The project is built upon the joksim/OpenGLPrj repository provided by the course professor, serving as the foundation for the OpenGL setup and rendering pipeline.

Blender Lite aims to provide a minimal yet functional 3D environment where users can visualize and manipulate geometric shapes in a simple, user-friendly way.
